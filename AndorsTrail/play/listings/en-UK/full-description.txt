Explore the world of Dhayavar looking for your brother Andor in this quest-driven fantasy RPG inspired by old-school classics like Ultima, Rogue and Legend of Zelda.

Battle monsters in turn-based combat, become stronger through level ups and skills, choose from a wide range of equipment, interact with numerous NPCs, visit shops, inns and taverns, search for treasure, and solve quests to follow the trail of your brother and uncover the secrets of the powers at play in Dhayavar. With luck, you may even find a legendary item!

You can currently visit up to 497 maps and complete up to 63 quests.

Android Pie (9.0) users: if you experience crashes after battles, avoid the options using "Short notifications" in the "Display monster loot" preference. We'll work around this android bug soon.

The game is completely free. There is no payment to install, no ads, no in-app purchases, and no DLCs. There is no internet access required, and it can run on all versions of Android from 1.6 (Eclair), so it should run on any device, even low-end oldies.

Andor's Trail is open-source software, released under the GPL v2 license.
