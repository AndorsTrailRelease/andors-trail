As I opened my eyes the Sun was the first thing I saw and I loved and cherished it. Ewa, my god, talked to me then for the first and the last time. He told me he had sent me here to help the humans. \nI crossed a forest, elated by this brave new world. Then I met the humans. You're weak creatures, do you know? In my world all had what you call here godly powers. They saw me and fell on their knees. I spoke to them and they chose me as Queen.\nI taught them how to pray and told them to cherish the beauty of the sun.\nThen my kingdom expanded and my capital, called Fallhaven today became a beautiful city. From what is now Nor City to Feygard every man was under my rule and I tried to be just and moral.\nCenturies passed from the year I came to this world and my ruling came to it's apogee. Then I heard from my Southern Governor that a new sect was growing in Nor City. They believed in the Shadow and their priest called the commoners to rebel against the \"Tyranny of the Light\".\nAt that time the official religion was based on the everlasting fight of the Shadow, my brother Elythor which came to this world but didn't take any mortal appearance, and the Light, me. I learned the man to love them both and find in the day the power to act and in the night the power to think. I taught it was just. \nBut the man is a strange creature, my kingdom could have lasted for thousand of years, until the end of times but some called me a tyrant and wanted the freedom to be ruled by mere mortals. I could not accept this heresy and told the guard to destroy this sect but I acted as a fool and it just helped them to gain more followers. The Shadow became a religion of hatred. Their priest believed in nothing, they just wanted to rule the masses. Their sought for power led them to overthrow the governor and constitute the \"Free City of Nor\".\nIt was not enough for them. Their priests were sent in each city and were all speaking of rebellion and hate. I tried to stop them but I couldn't. They were like rats, hiding in the shadows. Then came the war. \nUnder my rule necromancy was strictly forbidden as it was against life and morality. But the priests started practicing it and soon formed an army of undead which plagued the regions that were still under my rule. Soon they were in Fallhaven. I was in my church when the legions came. They were led by a necromancer and five priests.\nUsing their dark magics they immobilized me and splat my soul in three parts. My three highest councilors were turned into evil demons bound to guard my soul parts and kill anyone who would try to recover them.\nNow that you know the story you might understand why we had to test you. If you accept to help us to rise again your reward will be beyond your greediest dreams."
