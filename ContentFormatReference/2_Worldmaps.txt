Worldmaps format.

[b]Worldmaps use a custom XML format. All worldmaps are defined in a single worldmap.xml file located under res/xml/ in the game source.[/b]

The root tag is always "[b]worldmap[/b]" and is composed of several "[b]segment[/b]" sub-tags. Each worldmap in ATCS represent a separate "segment". Worldmaps are really best created and edited using ATCS, but masochists can use any text editor.

A "[b]segment[/b]" tag has the "[b]x[/b]" and "[b]y[/b]" properties, both with numerical values, that indicate an offset to the position of all contained areas.

A "[b]segment[/b]" tag has any number of "[b]map[/b]" and "[b]namedarea[/b]" sub-tags.

Each "[b]map[/b]" tag represent a TMX map that has to appear on the worldmap segment.

[list]A "[b]map[/b]" tag [u]must [/u]have the following attributes:
- "[b]id[/b]" with a textual value matching the ID of a TMX map.
- "[b]x[/b]" with a numerical value corresponding to the X-coordinate of this map within the segment.
- "[b]y[/b]" with a numerical value corresponding to the Y-coordinate of this map within the segment.
[/list]
[list]A "[b]map[/b]" tag [u]can [/u]have the following optional attribute:
- "[b]area[/b]" with a textual value matching the "[b]id[/b]" attribute of a "[b]namedarea[/b]" tag from the same segment. Use this when the map is part of a named area of the map, like a town.
[/list]

Each "[b]namedarea[/b]" tag represent a label on the map, like a town name. The label will be displayed centered on the bounding box of all maps that are part of this "[b]namedarea[/b]".

[list]A "[b]namedarea[/b]" [u]must [/u]have the following attributes:
- "[b]id[/b]" with a textual value. This is the value that must be referenced in the "[b]area[/b]" attribute of the "[b]map[/b]" tags.
- "[b]name[/b]" with a textual value. This is the value displayed to the players, so it must be properly capitalized, and can contain spaces.
- "[b]type[/b]" with a textual value. It typically contains "settlement" for towns and "other" for the rest, but while the field is mandatory, it is unused by the game engine.
[/list]
